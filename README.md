## Components
The implemented game is accessible via a web browser and provides at least the following features:
- Display a list of random words defined in an array.
- Display a grid that includes the words in random positions, in all possible directions.
- Three levels of the game, where the grid size, number of words, and word length vary.
- Limited game time, depending on the level.
- Scoring system.
- Ability to add new words.
- Word selection mode by selecting the first letter and dragging the mouse in the right direction to the last letter, with gradual highlighting in the grid.

## Known Limitations
- The project was created using the create-react-app application.
- The "App.css" file defines the styles for all game components.

## Challenges
- Dynamically placing letters on the board in all directions.
- Applying different styles to elements of the same array.
- Ensuring the board does not change every second.
- Correctly implementing the game-over modal.
